Updating data with mutations
============================

So far in our example app, we have only been _fetching_ data from our GraphQL API endpoint. In this lesson, we’ll learn how to modify data on our server using GraphQL.

* * *

In a REST API, we typically use GET requests to fetch something, and POST / PUT / PATCH / UPDATE requests to change data on the server.

In GraphQL, however, the distinction is a bit simpler:

*   We use `query` when we need to fetch data
*   We use `mutation` when we need to modify anything

Let’s explore how to edit a book’s information, and look at how this affects the Apollo cache and how the changes are reflected in our Vue app.

* * *

Getting familiar with the `updateBook` mutation in the GraphQL playground
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before we start making any changes in our frontend Vue app, let’s learn how to update a books’s data in our GraphQL playground (you can always find it running on [`http://localhost:4000/graphql`](http://localhost:4000/graphql))

Let’s open the right **Docs** panel and look for the `updateBook` mutation there.

![https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1.opt.1643651026216.jpg?alt=media&token=955aedf2-fe6b-4d42-b080-d8dbb56066b9](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F1.opt.1643651026216.jpg?alt=media&token=955aedf2-fe6b-4d42-b080-d8dbb56066b9)

What can we learn from this?

First of all, we can see that our mutation accepts an argument of `UpdateBookInput` type and this argument is required (that’s why it has an exclamation mark `!` next to it). This means that if we don’t pass in this argument, the mutation will fail.

In the `Type Details` section, we can see the _return type_ of the mutation, which is what the request actually returns. In our case, we will have there a modified `Book`.

Let’s learn more about that `UpdateBookInput` parameter now. When clicking on it, we can see more details about it:

![https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F2.opt.1643651026217.jpg?alt=media&token=c805007c-7710-4e1d-8370-906a42ed0027](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F2.opt.1643651026217.jpg?alt=media&token=c805007c-7710-4e1d-8370-906a42ed0027)

So, it expects us to _always_ pass in the ID of the book (it has an exclamation mark, meaning it’s a required field) and we can optionally add any field from the `Book` type such as `title`, `description`, `rating`, `author`, and `year`. The fields we pass in will get updated.

* * *

### Writing our first mutation

Let’s write our first mutation. Imagine that `The Guardians` book became super popular and we want to set its rating to `5` .

First, we’ll need to know the ID of the book to modify:

![https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F3.opt.1643651032971.jpg?alt=media&token=cf7b79ad-485e-476a-a243-e4ac540c7550](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F3.opt.1643651032971.jpg?alt=media&token=cf7b79ad-485e-476a-a243-e4ac540c7550)

Now, let’s write the mutation, passing this ID in, along with a new rating:

    mutation {
      updateBook(input: {id: "n12clfp3K", rating: 5}) {
        id
        title
        rating
      }
    }
    

Let’s run it and then check the `allBooks` query again to make sure it’s updated.

![https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F4.opt.1643651036711.jpg?alt=media&token=faedc7aa-ddc8-4802-bad5-35ef6aa7279e](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F4.opt.1643651036711.jpg?alt=media&token=faedc7aa-ddc8-4802-bad5-35ef6aa7279e)

![https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F5.opt.1643651040405.jpg?alt=media&token=f602632d-4e9b-42b8-bdbc-a96ef37ab361](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F5.opt.1643651040405.jpg?alt=media&token=f602632d-4e9b-42b8-bdbc-a96ef37ab361)

Success! The `Book`’s rating has been changed to `5`

Now that we’ve learned the basics of how to work with mutations, let’s modify our application interface to be able to edit books from there.

* * *

Making our books editable
-------------------------

### Adding a component for editing book data

Let’s add a new Vue component to edit a book’s rating. This component should:

*   take a current book rating and book id as props,
*   render an input field to edit this value, and
*   close the form upon pressing the `Esc` or `Enter` button.

In this section, we will also print the new value in the console when pressing `Enter` — this will be replaced with the mutation call in the next step.

Let’s create this new **EditRating.vue** component in the **components** folder:

📃 **components/EditRating.vue**

    <template>
      <input
        type="text"
        v-model="rating"
        @keyup.enter="updateRating"
        @keyup.esc="$emit('closeForm')"
      />
    </template>
    
    <script>
    import { ref } from 'vue'
    export default {
      emits: ['closeForm'],
      props: {
        initialRating: {
          type: Number,
          required: true,
        },
        bookId: {
          type: String,
          required: true,
        },
      },
      setup(props, { emit }) {
        // we create a local copy of the prop to edit the rating
        const rating = ref(props.initialRating)
        const updateRating = () => {
          console.log(rating.value)
          emit('closeForm')
        }
    
        return { rating, updateRating }
      },
    }
    </script>
    

We are not currently making any use of the `bookId` prop but we will need in in the next step to call the `updateBook` mutation.

After we press `Enter` or `Esc` button, our component will emit a `closeForm` event. We will be listening to this event in the parent component, `App.vue`, and will close the form after it’s fired.

* * *

### Adding an edit button

Now, we need to modify the `App.vue` so we can edit the books from there.

We will create a new property called `activeBook` and add **Edit** buttons to the books in the list. When the **Edit** button is clicked, we will set this book as the `activeBook`. When a book is under editing, we will hide the list and display only the **EditRating** component instead.

Let’s start with modifying the `script` section, adding the **EditRating** component along with that `activeBook` reactive property:

📃 **App.vue**

    import { ref } from 'vue'
    import { useQuery, useResult } from '@vue/apollo-composable'
    import ALL_BOOKS_QUERY from './graphql/allBooks.query.gql'
    
    // import EditRating
    import EditRating from './components/EditRating'
    
    export default {
      name: 'App',
      components: {
        EditRating, //add EditRating to components
      },
      setup() {
        const searchTerm = ref('')
        const activeBook = ref(null) // add new reactive property for active book
        const { result, loading, error } = useQuery(
          ALL_BOOKS_QUERY,
          () => ({
            search: searchTerm.value,
          }),
          () => ({
            debounce: 500,
            enabled: searchTerm.value.length > 2,
          })
        )
    
        const books = useResult(result, [], data => data.allBooks)
    
        return { books, searchTerm, loading, error, activeBook }
      },
    }
    

Now we can also modify **App.vue**’s template to show the book rating, and open a form to edit the rating if we have an `activeBook`

📃 **App.vue**

    <template>
      <div>
        <input type="text" v-model="searchTerm" />
        <p v-if="loading">Loading...</p>
        <p v-else-if="error">Something went wrong! Please try again</p>
        <template v-else>
          <p v-if="activeBook">
            Update "{{ activeBook.title }}" rating:
            <EditRating
              :initial-rating="activeBook.rating"
              :book-id="activeBook.id"
              @closeForm="activeBook = null"
            />
          </p>
          <template v-else>
            <p v-for="book in books" :key="book.id">
              <!-- Display rating to see what we're editing -->
              {{ book.title }} - {{ book.rating }}
              <button @click="activeBook = book">Edit rating</button>
            </p>
          </template>
        </template>
      </div>
    </template>
    

Now our new UI is ready!

We’re now ready to replace the `console.log` with the GraphQL mutation we worked on earlier in the playground.

* * *

Calling the mutation from the Vue application
---------------------------------------------

Just like GraphQL queries, we will keep GraphQL mutations in the `.gql` files.

Let’s create one for our `updateBook` mutation:

📃 **graphql/updateBook.mutation.gql**

    mutation UpdateBook($id: ID!, $rating: Float) {
      updateBook(input: { id: $id, rating: $rating }) {
        id
        title
        rating
      }
    }
    

As you can see, we are passing two variables to our mutation: the first is a book `ID`, and the second is a new book `rating`. Where did these variables types came from?

When in doubt, we can always check the schema in our GraphQL playground:

![https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F7.opt.1643651047837.jpg?alt=media&token=1fa1ff90-ceac-49d2-88bd-bdc7a56295d1](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F7.opt.1643651047837.jpg?alt=media&token=1fa1ff90-ceac-49d2-88bd-bdc7a56295d1)

As you can see on the screenshot above, the `updateBook` mutation accepts a parameter of `UpdateBookInput` type. After clicking on `UpdateBookInput`, we can see that it has 6 fields: a required `id` field of the type `ID`, and five optional fields. `rating` has a type `Float` . Now we know types we should use for these variables in the mutation.

* * *

Now, let’s import our `updateBook` mutation into the **EditRating** component, along with VueApollo’s `useMutation` composable:

📃 **components/EditRating.vue**

    import UPDATE_BOOK_MUTATION from '../graphql/updateBook.mutation.gql'
    import { useMutation } from '@vue/apollo-composable'
    

`useMutation` is a composition function similar to the `useQuery` we used previously. It takes a mutation and options as parameters, and returns methods and properties specific to the GraphQL mutation state. The most important method returned from `useMutation` is `mutate` — it will send a mutation to our GraphQL server.

Let’s start writing our mutation:

📃 **components/EditRating.vue**

    const rating = ref(props.initialRating)
    
    const { mutate } = useMutation(UPDATE_BOOK_MUTATION, () => ({
      variables: {
        id: props.bookId,
        // rating.value is a string, and our schema requires rating to be Float
        // that's why we are parsing a float here
        rating: parseFloat(rating.value),
      },
    }))
    

It’s a good practice to use a function-returning object for the second parameter of `useMutation`. This way, you ensure that any changes to a component’s reactive data will be applied to the mutation’s variables.

Now, let’s call this mutation from the `updateRating` method:

📃 **components/EditRating.vue**

    const rating = ref(props.initialRating)
    
    const { mutate } = useMutation(UPDATE_BOOK_MUTATION, () => ({
      variables: {
        id: props.bookId,
        rating: parseFloat(rating.value),
      },
    }))
    
    const updateRating = () => {
      mutate()
      emit('closeForm')
    }
    

Now, when we edit the rating and press enter, the form closes, and after some time we can see the rating updates:

* * *

Our user interface is far from perfect now. The form is closing before the request is resolved, there is no loading state, and no error handling. We will improve this in the next part of the lesson, but for now let’s focus on what is happening under the hood and why the rating was updated in the UI.

If we check the `Network` tab, we can find the mutation call there:

![https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F9.opt.1643651052926.jpg?alt=media&token=21f3855f-67e1-4718-a41e-f6378f8ed4ad](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F9.opt.1643651052926.jpg?alt=media&token=21f3855f-67e1-4718-a41e-f6378f8ed4ad)

This response contains a book `id` and updated book data (in our case, we are the most interested in the updated `rating`).

Apollo Client considers `id` as an entity key, and it’s smart enough to recognize when we update a book and to _merge_ all the new data to the book with the same `id` if it’s already in the cache:

![https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F10.1643651055134.jpg?alt=media&token=00cea8cb-3d3f-4ecd-97b7-e6a5ac04fe6f](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F10.1643651055134.jpg?alt=media&token=00cea8cb-3d3f-4ecd-97b7-e6a5ac04fe6f)

What happens in the moment of the Apollo cache update? All the GraphQL queries that were fetching an updated entity (in our case, the book with id `n12c1fp3k`) will receive a new `result`. You can think about queries as ‘subscriptions’ to your Apollo cache. As soon as it’s updated, they receive a new value. That’s why in our **App.vue** the `books` property is recalculated and Vue re-renders a page to reflect changes.

But if we remove an `id` from the mutation result, there will be no cache update (and nothing will change in the UI):

📃 **graphql/updateBook.mutation.gql**

     mutation UpdateBook($id: ID!, $rating: Float) {
      updateBook(input: { id: $id, rating: $rating }) {
        # id
        title
        rating
      }
    }
    

As you can see, the mutation is sent and returns a response, but the cache is not updating because Apollo Client does not recognize what book was updated. Understanding the logic of this cache update is crucial for working with Apollo. Let’s return `id` back to the mutation and improve our **EditRating** component logic a bit.

* * *

Aliasing `mutate`
-----------------

When looking at the `updateRating` method, we can notice two issues:

*   It doesn’t do much except the mutation call and emitting an event
*   The `closeForm` event id fires synchronously while it should wait for the mutation to resolve

To fix the first issue, we will remove the `updateRating` method altogether and we will _alias_ a `mutate` as `updateRating`:

📃 **components/EditRating.vue**

    const { mutate: updateRating } = useMutation(UPDATE_BOOK_MUTATION, () => ({
      variables: {
        id: props.bookId,
        rating: parseFloat(rating.value),
      },
    }))
    

Now, when we call `updateRating` from the component template, it will call `mutate` under the hood.

We also need to wait for this mutation to be resolved to emit `closeForm`. To do so, we will return one more property from `useMutation` called `onDone`.

📃 **components/EditRating.vue**

    const { mutate: updateRating, onDone } = useMutation(
      UPDATE_BOOK_MUTATION,
      () => ({
        variables: {
          id: props.bookId,
          rating: parseFloat(rating.value),
        },
      })
    )
    

`onDone` is a hook that is triggered when the mutation is resolved. In its callback, we can specify any logic we want to be executed after the mutation has returned a response. In our case, we want to call `closeForm` there:

📃 **components/EditRating.vue**

    const { mutate: updateRating, onDone } = useMutation(
      UPDATE_BOOK_MUTATION,
      () => ({
        variables: {
          id: props.bookId,
          rating: parseFloat(rating.value),
        },
      })
    )
    
    onDone(() => {
      emit('closeForm')
    })
    

Note

Now the form waits to close until we have a response from our GraphQL API.

* * *

Handling loading and error states
---------------------------------

It would be nice to also somehow indicate that there is a mutation in progress. Let’s display a text “Updating” right below the input field and disable the input when we are waiting for the mutation response.

In order to do so, we need to return `loading` property first from the `useMutation` call:

📃 **components/EditRating.vue**

    const { mutate: updateRating, onDone, loading } = useMutation(
      UPDATE_BOOK_MUTATION,
      () => ({
        variables: {
          id: props.bookId,
          rating: parseFloat(rating.value),
        },
      })
    )
    

In order to use this new property in the template, we need to remember to return it from the `setup()`

📃 **components/EditRating.vue**

    setup(props, { emit }) {
      const rating = ref(props.initialRating)
    
      const { mutate: updateRating, onDone, loading } = useMutation(
        UPDATE_BOOK_MUTATION,
        () => ({
          variables: {
            id: props.bookId,
            rating: +rating.value,
          },
        })
      )
    
      onDone(() => {
        emit('closeForm')
      })
    
      return { rating, updateRating, loading }
    },
    

As you probably noticed, we are not returning `onDone`. This is because we don’t call it elsewhere outside of the `setup`.

Now, let’s modify our template to display that loading message:

📃 **components/EditRating.vue**

    <template>
      <input
        type="text"
        v-model="rating"
        :disabled="loading"
        @keyup.enter="updateRating"
        @keyup.esc="$emit('closeForm')"
      />
      <p v-if="loading">Updating...</p>
    </template>
    

Now the UI reflects when our mutation is loading:

![https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F13.opt.gif?alt=media&token=0634adbf-eab6-4430-9311-57049ce031a5](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F13.opt.gif?alt=media&token=0634adbf-eab6-4430-9311-57049ce031a5)

* * *

### Handling Errors

The last (but very important!) change is handling an error. Similarly to `loading`, `useMutation` returns an `error` property:

📃 **components/EditRating.vue**

    const { mutate: updateRating, onDone, loading, error } = useMutation(
      UPDATE_BOOK_MUTATION,
      () => ({
        variables: {
          id: props.bookId,
          rating: +rating.value,
        },
      })
    )
    

After returning it from the `setup` , we can use this property to render an error message for the user:

📃 **components/EditRating.vue**

    <template>
      <input
        type="text"
        v-model="rating"
        :disabled="loading"
        @keyup.enter="updateRating"
        @keyup.esc="$emit('closeForm')"
      />
      <p v-if="loading">Updating...</p>
      <p v-if="error">{{ error }}</p>
    </template>
    

Now, in the `updateBook` mutation let’s change the mutation name to trigger an error:

📃 **graphql/updateBook.mutation.gql**

    mutation UpdateBook($id: ID!, $rating: Float) {
      randomName(input: { id: $id, rating: $rating }) {
        id
        title
        rating
      }
    }
    

After editing rating and pressing `Enter` we will be able to see an error message:

![https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F14.1643651065524.jpg?alt=media&token=f823b2bd-3a61-4dd5-bb54-06779724ca92](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F14.1643651065524.jpg?alt=media&token=f823b2bd-3a61-4dd5-bb54-06779724ca92)

* * *

Using fragments
---------------

If we take a look at our query and mutation, we can see they both share the same fields:no

Query:

    query AllBooks($search: String) {
      allBooks(search: $search) {
        id
        title
        rating
      }
    }
    

Mutation:

    mutation UpdateBook($id: ID!, $rating: Float) {
      updateBook(input: { id: $id, rating: $rating }) {
        id
        title
        rating
      }
    }
    

Of course, in our case it’s only three lines, but imagine if there were 30. Is there any way to reuse the same set of fields across different queries?

Yes! And it’s called _GraphQL fragments._ Fragments let you construct sets of fields, and then include them in queries where you need to.

Let’s create a new file called **book.fragment.gql** and add a new fragment to it:

📃 **book.fragment.gql**

    fragment BookFragment on Book {
      id
      title
      rating

Here `BookFragment` is a fragment name. It’s defined by the developer so you can choose whatever name you prefer. `Book` is a _type on which we create a fragment_. This must be a valid GraphQL type specified in your schema, and your fragment can **only** include fields that exist on this type.

Now, let’s make use of this fragment. In our `allBooks` query, we will import the fragment and replace the mentioned three fields with it.

📃 **allBooks.query.gql**

    #import './book.fragment.gql'
    
    query AllBooks($search: String) {
      allBooks(search: $search) {
        ...BookFragment
      }
    }
    

Remember to use spread operator when using a fragment!

Let’s do the same for the mutation:

📃 **updateBook.mutation.gql**

    #import './book.fragment.gql'
    
    mutation UpdateBook($id: ID!, $rating: Float) {
      updateBook(input: { id: $id, rating: $rating }) {
        ...BookFragment
      }
    }
    

Now, if we decide to change the set of the fields we are working with, we can make these changes on the fragment and they will apply to both the query and mutation

Wrapping Up
-----------

In this lesson, we have learned how to update data on our GraphQL server using mutations. But what if we add or delete a book? Apollo won’t have an `id` to implement cache updates, so our UI won’t reflect any changes… We will learn how to handle such cases with manual cache updates in the next lesson.
